  doc: Abstract representation for any kind of node in the topological graph We won't
    actually implement abstract nodes. Rather this is a parent group from which our
    more specific types of nodes will inherit. Note that NWB specifications have inheritance.
    The quantity '*' means that we can have any number (0 or more) nodes.
